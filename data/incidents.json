The attackers then spent eight months installing bitcoin mining software, establishing persistence, and creating fake accounts. In August, 2022, the group was able to escalate their attack through obtained credentials, gaining access to other Suffolk County departments before deploying BlackCat ransomware across the compromised systems. This resulted in 911 dispatchers using pen and paper, rather than their digital CAD system, and law enforcement officers calling in crime scene information via radio, rather than using their tablet-based emails.
