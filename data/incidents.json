The city stated that emergency services were not impacted, but the Oakland Police Department sent a tweet indicating that response times were delayed as a result. The primary impact of the attack was encryption and exfiltration of personnel files from the municipality, which were later identified for sale on the Dark Web. The attack was determined to be the work of the Play Ransomware group",
